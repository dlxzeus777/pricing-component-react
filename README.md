# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Using localStorage to save whether you've chosen 'Anually' or 'Monthly'
